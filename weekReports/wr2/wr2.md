# Lecture 2 Introduction to Linux Notes

## Important concepts:
* **Operating System:**
  An operating system provides all fundamental software features of a computer. 
* **Kernel:**
  An OS Kernel is a software component thats responsible for managing low-level features of the computer, including the following managing system hardware, memory allocations, CPU time, and program to program interaction.
* **Components of an operating system:**
  * Applications
  * Graphical Desktop Envioroment
  * Daemons and Shells
  * OS Kernel
  * Hardware
* **Linux:**
  A unix-like OS popular in academic and business enviroments.
* **Linux Characteristics:**
  * Open Source
  * Free of Charge
  * Unix Tools
  * Highly Scalabe
  * Many Buisnesses rely on Linux for day to day operations
  * A lot of server applications run some version of linux
  * Linux can be installed on any system.
* **GNU Toolchain:**
  A collection of compilers, libraries, debuggers, and core utilities modeled on Unix.
* **Linux Distribution:**
  A complete Linux system package:
  * A Linux Kernel
  * Core Unix Tools
  * Supplemental Software
  * Startup Scripts
  * An Installer
* **What is Ubuntu:**
  A Linux Distribution.
* **Ubuntu Release cycles:**
  * Regular or Non-LTS
  * LTS(Long-Term Support)
* **What is Debian:**
  An all-volunteer organization dedicated to developing free software.
* **Different software licensing models (open source vs closed source):**
  * **Open Source:** The software ma be distrubuted for a fee or free. The source codee is distributed with the software.
  * **Closed Source:** The softrware is not distributed with the source code. The user is restricted from modifying the code.
* **The 4 Freedoms of Free Software:**
  * **Freedom 0:** Use the software for any purpose.
  * **Freedom 1:** Examine the source code and modify it as you see fit.
  * **Freedom 2:** Redistribute the software.
  * **Freedom 3:** Redistribute the modified software.
* **Virtualization:**
  Defined as creating virtual versions of something.
* **Hypervisor and types:**
  Software or hardware in charge of creating, managing, and running virtual machines
  * **Type 1:** Runs directly on Hardware.
  * **Type 2:** Runs on an application on top of the OS.
* **VirtualBox:**
  A powerful x86 and AMD64/intel64 virtulization product for enterprise as well as home use.
